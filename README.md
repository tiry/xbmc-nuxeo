==========

Integration between Nuxeo DAM and XBMC media browser

This repo contains plugins for Nuxeo and for XBMC so that XBMC can browser assets (Videos / Audio / Pictures) stored inside a Nuxeo server.

For this to work there are 2 plugins :

## nuxeo-xbmc-connector

A Nuxeo plugin that exposes a dedicated Rest/JSON api for XBMC

## nuxeo-addon-for-xbmc

A python based plugin for XBMC that uses the Rest API to fetch data from the Nuxeo server.
