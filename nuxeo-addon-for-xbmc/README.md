# About

This is a very basic XBMC plugin that allows XBMC to browse assets stored in a remote Nuxeo server.

This XBMC plugin behaves like a virtual folder that fetches content from the Nuxeo server via Http/Json.
The plugin is declared in the 3 categories : Video / Audio / Picture

The plugin is pretty simple since all the navigation logic is handled on the server side.

# Installing

For now : copy the video.plugin.nuxeo folder in ~/.xbmc/plugins/ directory and restart XBMC
